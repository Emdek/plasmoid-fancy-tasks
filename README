Plasmoid providing a fancy representation of your tasks and launchers for those who need full power of task manager and fresh look.

Warning!
This applet uses standard libtaskmanager like other task managers in KDE, so before you report bug check if it also happens in other applets (for example Tasks).
Included panel is not stable yet and has some issues, use it at own risk.

Tips:
- To make applet more usable you can put it on panel with enabled option "Windows can cover" or similar.
- You can use theme with panel background similar to that of dock (for example Sabre Tiger) or modify current using Desktop Theme Details.
- You can add launchers to applet by drag and drop of URLs and desktop files when Plasma is unlocked or using configuration dialog.
- You can set "No Sorting" to make tasks show icon instead of launcher icon (not in tasks area);
- To show only launchers you need to remove tasks area item from arrangement.
- To show application jobs you need to add jobs area.
